Hi there.

I create simple c# bot to make fishing easier. the main idea was taken from https://github.com/adsau59/fishyboteso.

Sources

Reqs:
Fullscreen Windowed Mode (mby works with Fullscreen I didn't test it)

Provision's Chalutier Fishing plugin https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info...erFishing.html

Alot of Bait

Dont move the fucking Provision's Chalutier Fishing Widget, a bot gets widgets default position on the screen. if u move it just delete C:\Users\ivanm\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\SavedVariables\ProvisionsChalutier\.lua and relaunch the inteface

How it works:

bot checking widget color and sending "E" key command to start fishing or hook fish. no injection, no memory read, and co.
Resources:

0.1% CPU ~12MB RAM.

All u need to do some times select bait and move ur ass between fishing holes.

don't be hesitate to write ideas (how to make this bit better) in comments or make a commit on Github.

I don't know if u can be ban for this so, use it for u own risk


Have fun.
